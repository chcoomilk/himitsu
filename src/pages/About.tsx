                But, what you can't trust me is that the applications I deployed are EXACTLY the same as the ones in the source code.

                When you save a note, your request will be sent to the server.
                Once your request has arrived, a backend app literally written in the language of the gods will handle your request.
                From data encryption to everything, except maybe fixing this hot global warming, it will all be taken care of for you. <br /> <br />

              <Accordion.Header>Which encryption method should I choose?</Accordion.Header>
              <Accordion.Body>
                If you're using backend encryption,
                before your stuff is saved into the database,
                it will get encrypted using the password you provided
                and the salt from the server. <br />
                Assuming the hacker got access to all the encrypted data in the database.
                The hacker needs to know, one: the salt from the server, and two: the password which only you know.
                Which in theory, brute forcing the encrypted data would be improbable.
                <br /> <br />
                If you're using frontend encryption,
                The hacker can probably yank your secrets if it's encrypted with a weak password (or encryption, which is why it's labled 'experimental').
                But with frontend encryption, you're much more safer against {" "}
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">Man-in-the-middle attack</a>.<br />
                It's also much privacy oriented. If by any chance the server logs your requests,
                they can only see the encrypted strings of data that will be put in to the database.
                Unless if they're logging it from the frontend side,
                which is a stupid move because you can see every network activity happening in the application from your browser.

                For frontend encryption, we use AES-128 to encrypt both note's title and description.
                There's a great post about {" "}

                and you should check it out.
                The backend also use AES-256 encryption to encrypt both of the fields last mentioned and Argon2 for the password.
                But eventually, it all depends on your password. So, make sure to provide a good and strong password!
