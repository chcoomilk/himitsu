                  When you save a note, your request will be sent to the server.
                  Once your request has arrived, a backend app literally written in the language of the gods will handle your request.
                  From data encryption to everything, except maybe fixing this hot global warming, it will all be taken care of for you. <br /> <br />

                <p className="text-justify">
                  If you're using backend encryption,
                  before your stuff is saved into the database,
                  it will get encrypted using the password you provided
                  and the salt from the server.
                  Assuming the hacker got access to all the encrypted data in the database.
                  The hacker needs to know, one: the salt from the server, and two: the password which only you know.
                  Which in theory, brute forcing the encrypted data would be improbable.
                </p>
                <p className="text-justify">
                  If you're using frontend encryption,
                  The hacker can probably yank your secrets if it's encrypted with a weak password, 
                  because they only need to know your password.
                  But with frontend encryption, you're much more safer against {" "}

                  It's also much privacy oriented. If by any chance, the server hosting my app (in this case heroku) logs your requests,
                  they can only see the encrypted strings of data that will be put in to the database.

                  For frontend encryption, the app uses AES-128 for encryption.

                  and you should check it out.
                  The backend uses AES-256 for encryption and Argon2 for the password.
                  But eventually, it all depends on your password. So, make sure to provide a good and strong password!
