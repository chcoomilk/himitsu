                You can check out how my application work on my GitHub. 
                You can see if there's any line of code suspiciously saving personal info and all that. <br />
                But, what you can't trust me is that the applications I deployed are EXACTLY the same as the ones in the source code. 
                This means I can add some evil line of code to steal your personal data before deploying my app to the internet.  <br /> <br />

                When you save a note, your request will be sent to the server.
                Once your request has arrived, a backend app literally written in the language of the gods will handle your request.
                From data encryption to everything, except maybe fixing this hot global warming, it will all be taken care of for you. <br /> <br />

              <Accordion.Header>Why don't you encrypt my secret note on the frontend side?</Accordion.Header>
              <Accordion.Body>
                Let's say that I encrypt your stuff on the frontend and save the encrypted data on the backend.
                And then, say there's some sketchy dude that happened to guess right the ID of your secret note and decided to request it for himself.
                Because it's encrypted on the frontend, the backend has no idea if the request is coming from you or the people you trust.
                Now, back to the sketchy dude I mentioned, he will get the encrypted message from the server
                and brute force his way in. <br /> <br />
                <Image fluid src={sponge} alt="sponge" className="pt-3 pb-3" /> <br />
                That said, it maybe possible to implement end-to-end encryption or such method alike inside my app. 
                But, I just don't have enough experience to do it and I don't want to risk it.

              <Accordion.Header>What will happen to my secret note if the backend app got hacked?</Accordion.Header>
              <Accordion.Body>
                That is where your password comes in to help. <br /> <br />
                So, I'm assuming you know how my app in the backend works.
                Before your stuff is saved into the database, it will get encrpyted using the password you provided
                and the salt from the server. <br /> <br />
                Assuming the hacker got access to all the encrypted data in the database.
                The hacker needs to know, one: the salt from the server, and two: the password which only you know.
                Which in theory, brute forcing the encrypted data would be improbable.
